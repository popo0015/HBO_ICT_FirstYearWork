Answer the following questions using SQL queries.

1. How many models are in the database? - 10
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Roomba;

2. How many models have Random navigation? - 4
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Roomba WHERE Navigation = "Random"

3. Which model(s) can Auto Empty but do not have the capability to Save their Maps? - I3+
SELECT Model FROM Roomba WHERE AutoEmpty = "TRUE" AND MapSaving = "FALSE"

4. What is the highest dust capacity of all the models? (only show the Model and Capacity) - 600
SELECT Model, Capacity FROM Roomba
WHERE Capacity = (SELECT MAX(Capacity) FROM Roomba);

5. Which 2 models have the highest run time (show only Model and Runtime)? - 120, 90
SELECT Model, RunTime from Roomba ORDER BY RunTime DESC LIMIT 2;

6. What the average Overall cleaning capability of Standard efficiency and High Efficiency models, respectively?
SELECT Filtration, AVG(CleanOverall) AS OveralCleaning from Roomba 
GROUP BY Filtration;

7. What is the average Deep Cleaning capabilities of all models that have a “High Efficiency” filtration system? (Show the filtration type and the Average)
SELECT Filtration, AVG(CleanDeep) AS OveralCleaning from Roomba 
WHERE Filtration = "High Efficiency"
GROUP BY Filtration;

8. Which models have a better carpet cleaning than hard wood cleaning capacity?
SELECT Model, CleanCarpets, CleanHardFloors from Roomba 
WHERE CleanCarpets > CleanHardFloors;

9. What is the average runtime of the Models with different cleaning capacities? (Show the capacity and the average)
