# 📚 First-Year HBO-ICT Repository 🚀

Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where I've curated all my adventures of my first year as an ICT student at HZ University of Applied Sciences. This repository is my digital backpack 🎒, filled with designs, practice exercises, exams, pdf materials and projects that have accompanied me through the twists and turns of learning to code.

## About This Repository 📖

As a first-year ICT student, I've quickly learned that coding isn't just about typing commands into a computer; it's about solving puzzles, thinking creatively, and building something amazing from scratch. This repository serves as a living diary 📔 of my journey through the world of Information and Communication Technology.

I am also creating GitHub Wiki pages (specifically for Laravel), that can hekp students navigate through the material:
